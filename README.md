# Hi, I'm Priya

Forked and edited from: https://github.com/molly/manager-README

I'm looking forward to getting to know you! This document is a user-guide for anyone joining my team. Its intention is to give you an idea of how I think and how I work. This document is also a work-in-progress. Shout-out to Theo for sharing this idea. 

## My role as a manager

**TL;DR: I am here to make sure you are successful, happy, and working on the things that are most important and relevant for your growth in this company**

More granularly:

1.  I am here to make sure you are both successful and happy: I want you to help you grow your career, enjoy your work, build trust, and believe in both your projects and our company's mission.
2. I am here to be an advocate for you to People Operations. Any questions, concerns, challenges or issues you find yourself in - I am happy to run interference and get it resolved to best of my abilities.  
3. I am here to give you honest and healthy performance reviews. I don't want this to be a one-sided review, but a two-way stream of communication. This is in the hopes of being completely transparent and offer support when needed. 
4. I am here to keep you informed of any leadership announcements or any impending projects that I am aware of. 

## Feedback

If you have feedback for me, please give it. It could be something you liked and would like to see more of, something you thought I could do better, something you thought I totally screwed up, or something that doesn't fit in any of these categories. Even if you think it might not be the case, I _do_ want to hear it. And if you think I don't want to hear it, I'd love to hear why you feel that way.

If you can give me this feedback face-to-face (teams or in person), that's my preference. If you're only comfortable kicking off a discussion with an email or a teams message, I would rather you do that than not bring it up at all.

If you're not comfortable giving me some feedback yourself, I'd love for you to give it to someone above me in the management chain so they can anonymously relay it to me.

Similarly, if you have feedback for a team member or colleague, I encourage you to give it to them directly; if you're not comfortable doing so, let's chat and I can either get the feedback to them or we can figure out a way to deliver it that makes you comfortable.

## One-on-ones

I will put thirty minutes on your calendar each week for a one-on-one. If you need more time, let me know and I will adjust. 

One-on-ones are _your time_. I will probably have some things to discuss with you, but this is first and foremost your opportunity to let me know how you're doing, what you need, what you wish could be different, how you feel about your team and your teammates, what your career goals are... etc. 

I encourage you to write down some things throughout the week that you want to chat about if you think that will help, since it can sometimes be hard to think of or bring up things in the moment. If you have things you want to talk about but struggle with bringing them up, feel free to send me a vague agenda ahead of time. If you don't know what to talk about, say so. We can use that as a topic.

These are some interesting articles I've read about one-on-ones, though I don't necessarily agree with all of the points: [1](https://getlighthouse.com/blog/effective-1-on-1-meetings/), [2](https://medium.com/@mrabkin/the-art-of-the-awkward-1-1-f4e1dcbd1c5c). If you have thoughts on either, that might make a good topic to include in a one-on-one.

### Performance

I will give you feedback on how you're doing continuously, including in our one-on-ones. If I'm worried about your performance, I will let you know. My goal is for you to never be unsure about how you're performing (and how I think you're performing). If you ever feel unsure about either of these things, please let me know.

## My schedule

I currently work entirely remotely. I generally consider my work hours to be 9am to 5pm, though this varies somewhat depending on meetings. If I am not available during my normal hours for some reason, I will mark it in my teams status (and on my calendar if I am out for a day or more).


### After-hours communication

I will get a sense of your normal working hours as we begin working together, and I will make a strong effort not to message you outside of these hours because I know many people have teams notifications sent to their phone. I will sometimes send emails outside of your working hours (especially if we're in different time zones), as emails don't tend to notify people quite as intrusively; you should not feel obligated to respond until you are working. If you are receiving after-hours teams messages from me with any frequency, please let me knowâ€”it may mean I'm misunderstanding the hours you normally work.

Similarly, if you email me or send a teams message outside of my working hours, I may not respond quickly. I do try to keep up with notifications in case there's anything urgent, but if I read a message and it's non-urgent, I may leave it until the next working day. If you have something non-urgent you want to tell me and it's outside of my work hours, I don't mind if you send a teams message, though I always appreciate an explicit note that it's non-urgent! If you need me urgently outside of work hours, calling me is the best way to get hold of me.

## If you need something

1.  Message me or set up an impromptu Teams meeting.
2.  Throw something on my calendar. If I am scheduled for an interview or something else I can't reschedule and you invite me to a meeting, I may chat with you and reschedule.

Even though I work from home now, you can expect me to be as available as I would be if I was in the office. Although it may feel weird to schedule a brief teams meeting when you'd normally just swing by my desk for five minutes, please do so without hesitation if you think chatting face-to-face or screen-sharing will be more useful than textual communication.

## Caveat

This is a working document, there will be edits in future.
